# Peter DVD Intro

**Q:**
> A "DVD"-like intro in static html, but instead of "DVD" it writes "Peter", can you do it with pure html, css and js?

**A:**
> Sure! Here's a pure HTML, CSS, and JS implementation of a "DVD-style" bouncing logo intro, but instead of "DVD", it says "Peter".
This mimics the classic DVD screensaver effect, with "Peter" bouncing around the screen and changing color when it hits the edge. <br><br>
✅ Full Working Code (Copy & Paste into an .html file):

```./index.html``` <--

> 🔧 Features: <br><br>
✅ "Peter" text moves around the screen <br>
✅ Bounces off all edges <br>
✅ Changes color and glow on each bounce <br>
✅ Uses only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no libraries)

> Let me know if you'd like:
> * A logo instead of text
> * Slower/faster movement
> * Custom font or sound effects
> * Gradient backgrounds or trails like old screensavers
> <br><br> I can tweak it however you want.
